Hi, I am Marc Planelles and this is my blog.

I am an aspiring software developer with a previous background in Economics.
You can expect articles on open-source software, GNU/Linux, Emacs and the occasional thoughts
on the state of society.

You can contact me through [email](mailto:contact@planelles.dev).
