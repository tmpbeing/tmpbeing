  I love tools. Whether they are hardware or software, tools are the things that
  empower humans to build. And so I highly value good tools as they allow us to
  build things better, faster and/or more easily. As a software engineer my most
  used tools are my
  <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">text editor</a>, my
  <a href="https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty">terminal emulator</a> and my
  <a href="https://i3wm.org/">window manager</a> and therefore I spend a lot
  â€”some would say too much- of time
  <a href="https://github.com/tmpbeing/dotfiles">customizing</a> them as the
  best tools should fit the hand of their user. And in the physical world we
  have computers, keyboards and mouses which are the essential tools for writing
  software.

  Over the years I have bought many keyboards with varying degrees of quality,
  noise or actuation force required. But I recently went further and bought my
  first fully programmable keyboard -and also first split layout keyboard- : the
  <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/">ErgoDox EZ</a>. A programmable keyboard
  means you can fully customize what happens when you press/release a key. For
  the Ergodox EZ you can do so through an excellent online tool but this tool
  still has it&rsquo;s limitations. So I went another route and decided to
  configure my keyboard directly through it&rsquo;s firmware instead : the
  powerful and open-source <a href="https://qmk.fm/">QMK firmware</a>. You can
  find my WIP configuration on
  <a href="https://github.com/tmpbeing/ergodox-layout">GitHub</a>.

<p>
  But what makes a programmable keyboard worth it&rsquo;s price ? I&rsquo;ll go
  over some of the features and provide some examples of uses I came up with
  after owning the EZ for a few weeks.

<div id="outline-container-org95ebc5f" class="outline-2">
  <h2 id="org95ebc5f"><span class="section-number-2">1</span> Layers</h2>
  <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
    <p>
      First of all there&rsquo;s the layers. A lot of keyboards have layers (the
      <code>FN</code> key) but with a programmable keyboards you can define your
      own that fit your needs. For example I am french but I use the QWERTY
      layout as I find it better to program with than AZERTY where some special
      characters are less accessible. That means however that making special
      french accentuated characters requires that I hold <code>Alt-Gr</code>,
      press the required accent and then the character I want accentuated. This
      can be quite tedious. So I programmed myself a layer which includes a
      variety of accentuated characters. Layers could also be used is to learn a
      new layout (e.g. DVORAK or COLEMAK) while still having your usual layout
      for when you need to be productive.

<div id="outline-container-org31228bf" class="outline-2">
  <h2 id="org31228bf">
    <span class="section-number-2">2</span> Custom keycodes
  </h2>
  <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
    <p>
      I use <code>~</code> a lot more than <code>`</code> and so would rather
      have the back-tick when I hold shift and tilde otherwise. With custom
      keycodes I can. Basically they allow you to define the behavior of a new
      key or modify the behavior of existing keys.

<div id="outline-container-orgb664e6d" class="outline-2">
  <h2 id="orgb664e6d"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> Oneshots</h2>
  <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
    <p>
      Oneshots allow you to press a modifier key one time and it will stay
      active until you press another key. Once a key is pressed, the modifier is
      lifted. The same can be done for layer toggles. You can also have a key
      behave as oneshot if quickly pressed and behave normally when
      long-pressed. You can configure oneshots to timeout after a while.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orga21cac6" class="outline-2">
  <h2 id="orga21cac6"><span class="section-number-2">4</span> TapDance</h2>
  <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
    <p>
      The TapDance extension allows you to have keys behave differently
      depending on the number of presses. For example I use tap-dance to have a
      single key for
      <code>[</code>, <code>{</code> and <code>(</code>. Said key behaves as
      <code>[</code> normally, <code>{</code> when shifted and <code>(</code>
      when double pressed.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orga30ab8b" class="outline-2">
  <h2 id="orga30ab8b"><span class="section-number-2">5</span> Leader</h2>
  <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
    <p>
      If you&rsquo;re familiar with vim leader key, this is essentially the same
      thing for your keyboard : you press <code>LEADER</code> then a sequence of
      keys and the keyboard will perform the action programmed for said
      sequence.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orge3e2c61" class="outline-2">
  <h2 id="orge3e2c61"><span class="section-number-2">6</span> Auto-shift</h2>
  <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">
    <p>
      This is a feature that I don&rsquo;t use but I know many people enjoy it.
      With it you can tap a key for a non-shifted key and tap it longer for the
      shifted version.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org7aa460a" class="outline-2">
  <h2 id="org7aa460a">
    <span class="section-number-2">7</span> Combining those features
  </h2>
  <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-7">
    <p>
      We can combine these features to make powerful keys. For example, I built
      myself a key to control my window manager or Tmux. When pressed once it
      activates my WM layer and oneshots the <code>GUI</code> (aka Windows/Cmd)
      modifier which is the modifier key used by my window manager, when a key
      is pressed or the timeout is reached the keyboard returns to it&rsquo;s
      initial state. When pressed twice, the TMUX layer is activated and my Tmux
      prefix key (<code>Ctrl-A</code>) is sent. Ultimately these two layers
      should have similar actions for each key.
    </p>

    <p>
      As you can see a programmable keyboard -with the QMK firmware- is a
      powerful tool and I am very happy with mine. So far I have been able to
      implement everything I tried to. There is however the downside that it
      requires some time investment if you want it to be tailored to your needs.
      The other downside that I&rsquo;ve found is that whenever I have to work
      on a standard keyboard I miss mine and need some time to re-adapt. This is
      amplified by the fact that the ergodox EZ is ortholinear and splitted.
