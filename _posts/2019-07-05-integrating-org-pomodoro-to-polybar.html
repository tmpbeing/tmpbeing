<p>
I like to use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">pomodoro technique</a>. Initially I built myself for fun a simple daemon in Rust to
handle the pomodoro cycles and I would display it's output periodically in my
<a href="https://polybar.github.io/">status bar</a> to be able to keep track of said cycles at a glance. But after a while of using that I switched to the
most excellent <a href="https://github.com/marcinkoziej/org-pomodoro">org-pomodoro</a> as it integrated better with my existing workflow. I
wanted to keep my status bar indicator though as I'm not always in Emacs so I
had to write a script to get the current pomodoro status.
</p>

<p>
This is what it looks like :
<img src="/images/org-pomodoro-polybar.png" alt="org-pomodoro-polybar.png" />
You can toggle the amount of information shown and the icon and color depend on the status.
</p>

<p>
For this I'll assume you're running Emacs as a daemon. You'll also need the
<a href="https://github.com/gabrielelana/pomicons">pomicons font</a> installed on your system. If you're only interested
in the code you can find it here but for this article I'll go over the process
of creating the script.
</p>

<p>
First we have to get from Emacs the current org-pomodoro status. To do so we
will use the following command :
</p>
{% highlight lisp %}
emacsclient --eval '(if (org-pomodoro-active-p) org-pomodoro-state -1)'
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
<code>Emacsclient --eval</code> sends a command to the daemon and gives us it's return.
<code>(if (org-pomodoro-active-p) org-pomodoro-state -1)</code> returns the pomodoro state
if org-pomodoro is active. Otherwise it returns -1.
</p>

<p>
Let's put the result of that command in a variable and print a different icon
depending on the state :
</p>
{% highlight bash %}
#!/usr/bin/env bash

STATE=$(emacsclient --eval '(if (org-pomodoro-active-p) org-pomodoro-state -1)')
case "$STATE" in
    ":pomodoro")
        echo -e "%{F#B77A76}\ue003";;
    ":short-break")
        echo -e "%{F#958090}\ue005";;
    ":long-break")
        echo -e "%{F#7DAEA9}\ue006";;
    *)
        echo -e "\ue007";;
esac
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
This will print a different icon depending on the state (pomodoro, short break
or long break) or print a ghost icon if no pomodoro state is found (that
includes errors). The <code>\ue003</code> is used to print the <a href="https://github.com/gabrielelana/pomicons">corresponding unicode.</a> The <code>%{F#hexcolor}</code> part is a <a href="https://github.com/polybar/polybar/wiki/Formatting#format-tags-inside-polybar-config">polybar format tag</a>, you can
change them to the colors of your choice.
</p>

<p>
The polybar config looks like the following :
</p>
{% highlight INI %}
[module/pomodoro]
type = custom/script
exec = /path/to/the/script.sh
interval = 5
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
The interval is 5 seconds to avoid using too much resources.
</p>

<p>
We could stop there but I wanted it to be able to optionally show the time and
the current task, meaning I wanted to be able to switch between different output
formats.
To do so, we need to have some way to keep track of a state. Environment
variables aren't an option as the script is called as a child and therefor
cannot modify the environment of the parent. This means we have to use a file
instead, like so :
</p>
{% highlight bash %}
OUTPUT_STYLE_FILE="/tmp/pomodoro-polybar-output-style"

# If the file doesn't exist, default to SIMPLE output style
if test -e "$OUTPUT_STYLE_FILE"
then
    OUTPUT_STYLE=$(cat "$OUTPUT_STYLE_FILE")
else
    OUTPUT_STYLE="SIMPLE"
fi

if [ "$#" == "0" ]; then
    case "$1" in
        "SIMPLE")
            print_pomodoro_state_simple;;
        "LONG")
            print_pomodoro_state_long;;
        *)
            print_pomodoro_state_full;;
    esac
fi

# Toggle env variable to know what kind of output to show
if [ "$1" == "toggle" ]; then
    case "$OUTPUT_STYLE" in
        "SIMPLE")
            NEW_OUTPUT_STYLE="LONG";;
        "LONG")
            NEW_OUTPUT_STYLE="FULL";;
        *)
            NEW_OUTPUT_STYLE="SIMPLE";;
    esac
    echo $NEW_OUTPUT_STYLE > /tmp/pomodoro-polybar-output-style
fi
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
So now the output style depends on the content of the
<code>/tmp/pomodoro-polybar-output-style</code> file if it exists and defaults
to simple otherwise.
If the script is called with the <code>toggle</code> argument it will toggle between the
different output styles and if called without it will output the pomodoro state
depending on the set output style.
</p>

<p>
All we have to do now is implement the different print functions.
For starters we can get the remaining time.
</p>
{% highlight bash %}
set_remaining_time() {
    TIME_REMAINING=$(emacsclient --eval '(org-pomodoro-format-seconds)')
    TIME_REMAINING="${TIME_REMAINING%\"}"
    TIME_REMAINING="${TIME_REMAINING#\"}"
}
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
Emacs output is between quotes, i.e. <code>"25:00"</code>, so we have to remove them, here
using bash built-ins. Same for the current task :
</p>
{% highlight bash %}
set_task_at_hand() {
    TASK_AT_HAND=$(emacsclient --eval '(org-no-properties org-clock-current-task)')
    TASK_AT_HAND="${TASK_AT_HAND%\"}"
    TASK_AT_HAND="${TASK_AT_HAND#\"}"
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
I'll just go over one of the 3 print functions :
</p>
{% highlight bash %}
print_pomodoro_state_full() {
    set_state_and_pomodoro_icon
    if [ $STATE = ":pomodoro" ]; then
        set_remaining_time
        set_task_at_hand
        echo -e "$ICON $TIME_REMAINING $TASK_AT_HAND"
    elif [ $STATE = ":short-break" -o $STATE = ":long-break" ]; then #No current task to print
        set_remaining_time
        echo -e "$ICON $TIME_REMAINING"
    else # Org-pomodoro not running, nothing else to print
        echo -e "$ICON"
        exit
    fi
    exit
}
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
<code>set_state_and_pomodoro_icon</code> is just a modified version of the first version of
the script that populates a variable ICON with the color and icon to print
instead of echoing it.
We have 3 cases :
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We are in a pomodoro so we need the icon, the remaining</li>
</ul>
<p>
time and the task description and then echo them all at once.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We are in a break and so only the icon and remaining time are relevant.</li>
<li>We are not in either and so only display the away icon.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Putting it all together, you can find the end result <a href="https://gist.github.com/tmpbeing/0af5d6f44d8978a29035c415a4cd8fe4">here</a>.
